## Background Information

[![Image of Blacktip Shark (Carcharhinus limbatus)](images/Carcharhinus%20limbatus-01.jpg){width="500"}](https://www.google.com/imgres?q=Carcharhinus%20limbatus&imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fupload.wikimedia.org%2Fwikipedia%2Fcommons%2F2%2F29%2FCarcharhinus_limbatus_%25282%2529.jpg&imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FBlacktip_shark&docid=-6OTnHGl0wLLmM&tbnid=gmMHHqvZOIQXIM&vet=12ahUKEwiWs-TeyueSAxUGUUEAHYafKqMQnPAOegQIGRAB..i&w=1693&h=995&hcb=2&ved=2ahUKEwiWs-TeyueSAxUGUUEAHYafKqMQnPAOegQIGRAB)

This study investigates the migration of blacktip sharks (*Carcharhinus limbatus*) along the east coast of southern Africa to better understand their foraging ecology. Sharks were captured and fitted with surgically implanted acoustic transmitters in the coelomic cavity. A network of fixed acoustic receivers detects tagged individuals when they move within detection range, generating time-stamped records of presence along the coastline. Data were collected between 2020 and 2025 and will be analysed in R to characterise movement patterns and evaluate potential drivers of seasonal and spatial migration.

## Raw Data

The raw data files can be found [here](https://github.com/meganvanzyl/Honours_Blacktip_Project/tree/main/Data/Raw_Data).

### There are 3 raw data files:

#### The metadata of the blacktip shark individuals

This includes:

-   Tag IDs

-   Gender

-   Measurements (length from nose to tip of the upper caudal lobe)

-   Release location (longitude and latitude)

-   Catch Area

#### The Receiver Metadata

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
