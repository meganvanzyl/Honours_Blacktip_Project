## Background Information

!["Image of Blacktip Shark (*Carcharhinus limbatus*)"](images/Carcharhinus%20limbatus.jpg)

This study investigates the migration of blacktip sharks (*Carcharhinus limbatus*) along the east coast of southern Africa to better understand their foraging ecology. Sharks were captured and fitted with surgically implanted acoustic transmitters in the coelomic cavity. A network of fixed acoustic receivers detects tagged individuals when they move within detection range, generating time-stamped records of presence along the coastline. Data were collected between 2020 and 2025 and will be analysed in R to characterise movement patterns and evaluate potential drivers of seasonal and spatial migration.

## Raw Data

The raw data files can be found [here](https://github.com/meganvanzyl/Honours_Blacktip_Project/tree/main/Data/Raw_Data).

### There are 3 raw data files:

## Clean Data

### Blacktip Metadata

The tidy R Script can be found [here](https://github.com/meganvanzyl/Honours_Blacktip_Project/tree/main/Code/Tidy%20Blacktip%20Metadata%20Code).

#### Follow the step-by-step of how I cleaned the raw data file for the shark metadata:

```{r}
#| echo: true
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(lubridate)

# Here I am removing some columns from the blacktip_metadata file that NA values for all entries

clean_shark_data <- read.csv("Data/Raw_Data/blacktip_metadata.csv") %>%
  select(!c("sensor_slope", "sensor_intercept", "sensor_type", "sensor_unit","tag_model_name", "tag_serial_number", "dual_sensor_tag", "girth", 
            
# I am also removing information that is repeated in its respective column, such as scientific_name, tag_expected_life_time_days and tag_status
            
            "scientific_name", "tag_expected_life_time_days", "tag_status", "tag_id", "tag_project_name")) %>%
  
# Also, I am combining columns that contain the same data, such as tag_id and transmitter_id, as well as common_name and tag_project_name. I'll remove one of the replicate columns and rename the remaining one with both column titles
  
  rename(tag_transmitter_id = transmitter_id) %>%
  
# I want to separate the date and time data into their own respective columns
  
  separate(ReleaseDate, into = c("release_date", "time"), sep = " ", remove = FALSE) %>%
  mutate(release_date = ymd(release_date), time = hms(time)) %>%
  select(!c("ReleaseDate", "time"))

knitr::kable(clean_shark_data)
```
