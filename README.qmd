## Background Information

!["Image of Blacktip Shark (*Carcharhinus limbatus*)"](images/Carcharhinus limbatus.jpg)

This study investigates the migration of blacktip sharks (*Carcharhinus limbatus*) along the east coast of southern Africa to better understand their foraging ecology. Sharks were captured and fitted with surgically implanted acoustic transmitters in the coelomic cavity. A network of fixed acoustic receivers detects tagged individuals when they move within detection range, generating time-stamped records of presence along the coastline. Data were collected between 2020 and 2025 and will be analysed in R to characterise movement patterns and evaluate potential drivers of seasonal and spatial migration.

## Raw Data

The raw data files can be found [here](https://github.com/meganvanzyl/Honours_Blacktip_Project/tree/main/Data/Raw_Data).

### There are 3 raw data files:

#### The Blacktip Metadata of individual sharks

This includes:

-   Tag IDs

-   Gender

-   Measurements (length from nose to tip of the upper caudal lobe)

-   Release date (YYYY/MM/DD) and location (longitude and latitude)

-   Catch Area

#### The Receiver Metadata

This includes:

-   Station name and location (latitude and longitude)

-   Project Name: ORI

-   Deployment and recovery date (YYYY/MM/DD) and time (hms)

#### The Blacktip Detections

This includes:

-   Date (YYYY/DD/MM) and time (hms)

-   Receiver and Transmitter ID

-   Location (latitude and longtitde)

## Clean Data

### Blacktip Metadata

The R Script can be found here.

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
